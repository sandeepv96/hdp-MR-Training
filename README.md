=========================

Just some Hadoop and MapReduce homework and experiments.

Feel free to clone and do whatever you want at your own risk, I started this repository just to keep track of my advances in the Udacity course: Introduction to Hadoop and MapReduce.

I can offer no guarantee on the quality or functionality of this code.

You acknowledge I can't be held responsible of any harm, errors, side-effects, or any type of loss happening to you and/or your business by direct or indirect result of the use of the code in this repository.
